## 🎮 Game Modes

### 🎤 Classic Mode
Listen to a 30-second preview and try to guess the **song title** and **artist**. Score yourself:
- **+0** - Nothing correct
- **+1** - Title OR artist correct
- **+2** - Both correct!

Play endlessly and try to beat your high score. Songs never repeat within a session!

### 📅 Timeline Mode
A multiplayer (hot seat) game for 2-4 players:
1. Listen to a song preview
2. Guess where it fits chronologically in your timeline
3. Correct? The card is added. Wrong? It's discarded.
4. **First to 10 cards wins!**
